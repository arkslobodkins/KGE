Implementation of symmetric interior penalty Discontinous Galerkin
method with mass lumping for Klein-Gordon equation using deal.II library.
Tested on continuous problems in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions for
Dirichlet, Neumann, and Sommerfeld boundary conditions. Requires
support for C++11 or more recent version of C++. Problem parameters
are specified in src/ProblemParams.h.
